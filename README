This package contains base configuration for Archive Development "cloud" VMs.

It is not generally used for sandboxes (local development VMs): see
the bbcarchdev-sandbox-base package instead.

Note that this package depends upon packages which aren't present in the
official Wheezy repositories: puppet and opennebula-context. See the
documentation below to enable the Puppet and wheezy-backports repositories
before attempting to install this package.
